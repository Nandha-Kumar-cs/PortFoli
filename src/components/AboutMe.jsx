              Hello! Im Nandhakumar , and I'm a backend developer with a growing
              passion for frontend development. My journey into web development
              began recently, and since then, I've been excited by the endless
              possibilities of building things that live on the internet. <br />
              <br />I currently work as a <span>PHP backend developer</span>,
              where I focus on writing clean, efficient server-side code. While
              backend development is my foundation, I'm also deeply interested
              in crafting interactive and engaging user interfaces â€” a curiosity
              that drives me to explore <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and{" "}
              <span>Javacript</span> in my free time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm eager to contribute my skills and expertise to diverse teams
              across various industries, helping drive innovation and success.
            </p>
            <p>What's in my dev toolbox these days? Glad you asked !</p>
